Implementation of a Chained Hash Set data structure 


Assignment: By implementing the AmhHashSet<E> interface, create a chained hash set data structure
  
Files Given: AmhHashSet, HTGenerator, HTTester, WrapperHashSet, ChainedHashSet(Skeleton)
  
Written Code: ChainedHashSet
  
How to Test: By running HTTester with these arguments,
  
  java HTTester 10 simple-test.txt simple-test.log
  
  You will use the file simple-test.txt to test a Chained Hash Set with size 10, where the results of that test are put in a file called simple-test.log
  If you want to generate your own tests, you can do so like this:
  
  java HTGenerator 20 15 simple-test.txt
  
  This will generate the file simple-text.txt with 15 separate tests, each with a number ranging from 1 to 20.
